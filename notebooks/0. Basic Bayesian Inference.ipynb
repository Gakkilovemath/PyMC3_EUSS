    "\n",
    "The *de facto* standard for statistical inference is statistical hypothesis testing. The goal of hypothesis testing is to evaluate a **null hypothesis**. There are two possible outcomes:\n",

    "Instead of testing, a more informative and effective approach for inference is based on **estimation** (be it frequentist or Bayesian). That is, rather than testing whether two groups are different, we instead pursue an estimate of *how different* they are, which is fundamentally more informative. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we include an estimate of **uncertainty** associated with that difference which includes uncertainty due to our lack of knowledge of the model parameters (*epistemic uncertainty*) and uncertainty due to the inherent stochasticity of the system (*aleatory uncertainty*)."
